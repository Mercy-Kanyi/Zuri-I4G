[Rock, paper, scissors](https://github.com/Mercy-Kanyi/Zuri-I4G/blob/main/rock_paper_scissors/scissors.py) is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. The winner is determined according to a set of rules. You can find the official rules under the Resources.
